# ========================== MACROS ==========================
#
# Macros can specify shared / common attributes referenced by one or more risk rules below.
# If you choose to use specific macro for a given risk rule please specifying `macro: <macro-name>` in rule definition.
# Note: Attributes defined in macro will take precedence i.e. replace the same attributes defined on the rule level. 
#
# Macro can contain any of the following attributes:
#
# :query    - RedisGraph query (see README.md). Has precedence over :template. Requires :writer to be defined.
# :writer   - Writer is a (Ruby) expression used to format :query result set. Writer has precedence over :template.
# :template - Built-in query/writer template name. If :query & :writer are not specified then chosen 
#             query generator will be used along with matching writer. See rule attributes below for more information.
#
macros:
  # risky-role:
  #   query:    # Shared GraphQL query
  #   writer:   # Shared Writer expression (Ruby)  
  #   template: # Shared built-in query/writer template


# ========================== RULES ==========================
#
# Rule can contain any of the following attributes:

# :id              - [Required] Rule id should be a unique
# :group_title     - [Required] Title applying to all items falling under this risk check 
# :severity        - [Required] Severity, as one of :danger, :warning, :info
# :info            - [Required] Textual information about the check and suggestions on how to mitigate the risk
# :query           - [Conditonal] RedisGraph query (see README.md). Has precedence over :template. Requires :writer to be defined.
# :writer          - [Conditonal] Writer is a Ruby expression used to format query result set. Writer has precedence over :template. Required :query to be defined.
# :template        - [Conditonal] Built-in query/writer template name. If :query & :writer are not specified then chosen 
#                    query generator will be used along with matching writer. 
#                    Some templates require `:match_rules` attribute to be specified on individual rule level in order to build correct query. 
#                    Supported templates kinds:
#                      - risky-role : Builds multi-match graph query based on the access rule specified in :match_rules.
#                                     Attributes and values in :match_rule follow Kubernetes spec at:
#                                       * https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-examples
#                                     Generated graph query returns the following columns: 
#                                       * role_name
#                                       * role_kind
#                                       * namespace_name (an array is returned if multiple items returned)
# :match_rules     - [Conditonal] Required when :template relies on match rules in order to build a query.
#                    Example:
#                      match_rules:
#                      - resources: ['cronjobs']
#                        verbs: ['update']

# :custom_params   - List of custom key-value pairs to be replaced in resolved :query / :writer.
#                    Example: 
#                      custom_params:
#                      - attrA: valueA
#                      - attrB: valueB

#                    Templated placeholders for keys above `{{attrA}}` and `{{attrB}}` will be replaced with `valueA` and `valueB` respectively.

# :threshold       - [Optional] Numeric value. When definied this will become available as templated placeholder `{{threshold}}` in writer expression.
# :macro           - [Optional] Reference to common parameters set defined in a named macro
# :disabled        - [Optional] When set to `true` it'll disable given rule and exclude it from evaluation. 
#                    By default all rules are enabled.
